Created maven project in eclipse IDE
Added cucumber- eclipse plugin

created project structure
	PageObject (package)
	Utilities(package)
	StepDefinition(package)
	TestRunner (package)
	Features(folder for feature files)
	Target(folder  for reports)
	Updated pom.xml for project dependencies
created feature file (.feature ) for login test feature
created pageobject class for login web page
created step definition file for feature file (login test feature)
created test runner file to run test case
Generated test report
	
Session#2
---------
Data Driven Testing
	Scenario outline keyword
	Examples:
Generated Reports in HTML, JSON & XML format
Added new feature file (Add new customer)
	Created feature file (customers.feature)
	Added test steps in Gherkin language
	Created page object class for add new customer page
	created step definition for customers.feature file 
	Executed test script (customers.feature) using test 	runner file (run.java)

Session#3
----------
Added new scenarios in customers.feature file
	Scenario: Search customer by email
	Scenario: Search customer by name
Background keyword : for common / repeating steps in scenarios

Session#4
----------
Base class 
Executing multiple feature files
@Tags (or , and & and not operator)

Session#5
---------
What are Hooks
Types of hooks
	Scenario hook: @Before //executed before start of  each scenario execution
	& @After //executed after completion of each scenario execution
	
	Step Hooks: 
	@Beforestep //executed before each step execution
	@Afterstep //is executed before after each step execution

	Conditional hook:@Before("@Sanity")

How to capture screen shot of failed test scenarios

Session#6
------------
Logger integration in eclipse
	Apache-Log4j 2

Session-7
----------
Run test cases / feature file on specific browser
	configurtion.properties
	read properties

Session#8
----------
Execute test case using pom.xml within eclipse
Execute test case outside eclipse using maven(a build tool)
	a) Command Line Interface (CLI)
	b) Batch file
	c) Jenkins

1. Running Cucumber with TestNG framework
-------------------------------------- 
Step 1. Update Pom.xml
(a) Add:
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.testng/testng -->
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.testng</groupId>
			<artifactId>testng</artifactId>
			<version>7.4.0</version>
			<scope>test</scope>
		</dependency>
		
		<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.cucumber/cucumber-testng -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
    <artifactId>cucumber-testng</artifactId>
    <version>7.3.4</version>
</dependency>

(b) Remove:
Cucumber-junit dependency from pom.xml
(c) save pom.xml

Step2: Update maven project
Right click on pom.xml->select maven->update project

Step3:
a) Open test runner file (run.java)
b) Remove /comment out "@RunWith(Cucumber.class)"

c) Instead of junit imports , use testng imports in run.java
d) add "import io.cucumber.testng.AbstractTestNGCucumberTests;" in run.java
e) extend this class from "AbstractTestNGCucumberTests"

public class Run extends AbstractTestNGCucumberTests{
	/*This class will be empty*/
}

Step 3:
Create TestNG.xml file

2. Created multiple step definition classes
